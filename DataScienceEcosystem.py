# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives:**
# * List popular languages for Data Science
# * List commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists
# * Demonstrate arithmetic expressions in python

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. pyhton
# 2. R
# 3. SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. TensorFlow
# 2. NumPy
# 3. Matplotlib

# |**Data Science Tools**|
# |----------|
# |JupyterLab|
# |Visual Studio|
# |Spyder|
# 

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[6]:


x = 3
y = 8
print('x + y =')
print(x+y)
print('x * y =')
print(x*y)


# In[7]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[9]:


# This will convert X minutes to hours (Y) by diving by 60
X=200
Y=X/60
print(Y)
